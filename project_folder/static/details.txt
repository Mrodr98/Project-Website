My name is Mark Rodriguez, I am currently a junior at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley where I am majoring in computer science.
After graduation I hope to work as a software engineer and work on meaningful projects that can have a positive impact on the world and society, even if it's something as trivial as a feature in a piece of software that makes the user experience better.
